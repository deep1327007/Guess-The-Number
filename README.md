<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="0" data-line-end="1">Hey there! Welcome to my ‘Guess the Number’ project, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I embarked on this project during my vacation as a fun way to delve deeper into web development. It was an enlightening experience where I explored new concepts and techniques within these technologies.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="2" data-line-end="3">This project was inspired by a course led by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy. Following his guidance, I crafted this game, allowing users to enjoy guessing a number. Initially, I was hesitant about sharing it, but reflecting on my journey in frontend development, I realized its significance as my first step in this realm.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="4" data-line-end="5">Though it’s been a while since I developed this project, its impact remains unforgettable. It marks the beginning of my journey into frontend development—a crucial milestone I cherish.</p>
<p class="has-line-data" data-line-start="6" data-line-end="7">Feel free to explore the code and play the game! I’m excited to share this part of my learning process with you.</p>
